To test the codes, we need a web server(I used python to initiate a web server). For example type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer in this directory using a terminal. Then open a webbrowser to type localhost:8000 to see my webpage! This webpage has been tested in Chrome! (In this case, I used Node.js command prompt to type my command: python -m SimpleHTTPServer to get the server working, and I am still trying to figure out why C3.js couldn't be loaded if I don't type my command in the terminal!)

###For User's side: 
You can search Baltimore data you are interested in this website. There are many kinds of useful data in this website such as economy, population and City's recent unemployment rate. There are two sections for my project: The first part is the data visulization and data table for Baltimore's information, and the second part is a google map of the Baltimore (If you click the href link in the webpage, then you will see the google map for diaplaying baltimore city's major locations' information!) Hope you will like it!

###For Developer's side: 
We still need to work on this website project! For example, we need to create a login and logout webpage so that every user can have an account. Also, we need to link our data to a database system such as phpmyadmin, and then we can use the database system to store those large scale data instead of using a csv file or excel file. Using database can make handling of data become easier! That's why we need to use a database system to store all the data. Also, trying to save all the users' data can help us to create a more powerful search engine so that we can extract more information! In order to analyze the data, we can apply machine learning algorithms to make data become more understandable. If so, the users can quickly understand how data change and the meaning of the data.
