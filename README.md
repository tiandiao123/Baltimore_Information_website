To test the codes, we need a web server(I used python to initiate a web server). For example type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer in this directory using a terminal. Then open a webbrowser to type localhost:8000 to see my webpage! This webpage has been tested in Chrome!

For User's side: You can search Baltimore data you are interested in this website. There are many kinds of useful data in this website such as economy, population and City's recent unemployment rate. 

For Developer side: We still need to work on this website project! For example, we need to create a login and logout webpage so that every user can have an account. Also, we need to link our data to a database system such as phpmyadmin, and then we can use the database system to store those large scale data instead of using a csv file or excel file. Using database can make handling of data become easier! That's why we need to use a database system to store all the data. Also, in order to analyze the data, we can apply machine learning algorithms to make data become more understandable. If so, the users can quickly understand how data change and the meaning of the data.
